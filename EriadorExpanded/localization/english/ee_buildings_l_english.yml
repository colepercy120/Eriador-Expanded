 #building_wonder_tharbad_05:0 "Great Haven of Tharbad"
 #building_wonder_tharbad_05_desc:0 "Tharbad has now exceeded even its previous heights under the joint rule of Gondor and Arnor. The old city walls have been replaced with grand new fortifications, and thirteen mighty towers now encircle the city, standing watch over its streets and gates. The harbor, once modest, has been expanded into a vast and protected haven—the likes of which have not been built since the great days of Númenórean colonization. Merchant ships from across Middle-earth now crowd its docks, their sails bearing the colors of distant lands. \n\nWithin the city, Tharbad thrives as a center of trade, learning, and culture. Marble halls and stately houses line the broad avenues, while markets bustle with goods from Gondor, Arnor, and beyond. Scholars gather in its libraries, craftsmen ply their trades in busy workshops, and emissaries from distant realms walk the streets. Once a city of decay and ruin, Tharbad has become a shining jewel of the North, a testament to the strength and unity of the Reunited Kingdoms."
 
 #building_wonder_annuminas_04:0 "Annúminas - The Beacon of the West"
 #building_wonder_annuminas_04_desc:0 "Annúminas has risen from forgotten ruin to the very jewel of our kingdom, a testament to the growing might and wisdom of Men. Where once crumbling stones whispered of lost glory, a new Tower now ascends proudly over the shining waters of Lake Nenuial, crowned with a beacon whose light never wanes. No simple flame, this beacon burns with crafted sorcery — a permanent star wrought by the hands of Men, rivaling the works of the Elves of old. Its light washes over the city below, a symbol of an age where the arts of enchantment, once the sole dominion of the Firstborn, now answer to the will of mortal kings. Streets that were once dark and silent now gleam with the steady radiance of Feanorian Lamps — no longer rare relics but wonders replicated by human craft, illuminating every thoroughfare with their cold, brilliant glow. \n\nCitizens of Annúminas walk beneath this artificial day, their faces uplifted in awe and pride. Long have Men been thought lesser in the arts of magic, their lives too brief to master the deep craft of the world, but here that old belief crumbles. Our scholars, smiths, and mages have woven together knowledge gleaned from ancient tomes and elven mentors alike, surpassing what was once thought possible. In Annúminas, we shape light itself — bending it, binding it — until the night flees before us. What was once the gift of immortal hands is now the legacy of our people. We have reclaimed not just stone and land, but wonder, proving that the days of mortal Men are no longer dimmed by the shadow of their forebears."
 
 #building_wonder_barad_girithlin_02:0 "City of Girithlin"
 #building_wonder_barad_girithlin_02_desc:0 "Built around the ancient fortress of Barad Girithlin, we have raised walled city to serve as the center for the resotration of Cardolan and Sirgala. The city is not as glorious as Minas Tirith and the Tower not as strong as Orthanc, but it is perfectly servicable for the defense of Cardolan."
 
 #building_wonder_nelvorin_02:0 "Grand Library of Nelvorin"
 #building_wonder_nelvorin_02_desc:0 "Nelvorin has long held a quiet but revered place in the north of Eriador, known in ages past as a beacon of learning and lore. Its ancient libraries, vast and labyrinthine, once drew scholars from distant lands, their shelves heavy with tomes chronicling the wisdom of the Eldar and the deep history of Men. Yet as the years wore on and the world’s attention shifted, those proud halls fell into ruin — scrolls moldered, ink faded, and the very stones of the great archive crumbled beneath the weight of neglect. But now, with renewed purpose and the backing of king and council alike, Nelvorin rises again. Craftsmen and scribes labor side by side, restoring marble pillars and gilded domes while salvaging what knowledge yet lingers. No longer will these libraries be forgotten tombs of wisdom, but living halls of study, their doors open once more to the curious and the learned. \n\nWith this revival, Nelvorin is destined to reclaim its rightful place as the beating heart of scholarship in the North. Already, fresh works of lore and discovery are being penned within its walls — not merely copying the wisdom of the past, but forging new knowledge beyond the reach even of the Elves. Histories once thought lost are uncovered, languages of the elder days are spoken once more, and Men now rival the great chroniclers of old. Nelvorin stands not as a mere memory of glory, but as a symbol of the age of Men — where mortal hands craft wonders of the mind and spirit, proving that wisdom need not fade with the Elves but may flourish anew under human stewardship."
 
 #building_wonder_caras_celairnen_02:0 "Caras Celarinen - The Silver City"
 #building_wonder_caras_celairnen_02_desc:0 "Caras Celarinen has long stood as a vital artery in the trade networks of Arthedain, its fortunes tied to its enviable position between the shining towers of Annúminas and the fabled harbors of the Grey Havens. Nestled at the confluence of the Uialduin and the Lhûn, where river meets road and land meets sea, it was once a bustling crossroads — a place where merchants lingered, and travelers passed swiftly through. Yet now, through careful planning and wise investment, Caras Celarinen has transformed from a mere waypoint into a thriving city of wealth and splendor, rivaling any in the West. Stone quays stretch wide along the rivers, grand bridges span the waters, and towering halls rise above streets paved in clean-cut stone — a testament to the ambitions of Men and their growing mastery of craft and commerce. \n\nIts markets overflow with wonders gathered from across Eriador and beyond. Elvish marvels — delicate works of glass, shimmering fabrics, and subtle enchantments — gleam alongside the solid strength of dwarvish craft, with intricately forged tools, gleaming gems, and hardy steel traded openly beneath banners snapping in the wind. Caravans from the East mingle with ships from the Havens, their goods and tongues blending into a rich tapestry of culture and trade. Here, the old rivalries of race give way to profit and partnership, and in the crowded squares of Caras Celarinen, Men, Elves, and Dwarves walk side by side. It is a city not only of wealth but of ambition — a shining example of what the realms of Men may achieve when vision, gold, and the will to build converge."
 
 #building_wonder_carn_dum_02:0 "Minas Aira - the Red Tower"
 #building_wonder_carn_dum_02_desc:0 "At last, Carn Dûm — long the black heart of Angmar — stands cleansed of its ancient evil. The twisted spires and crumbling battlements that once loomed like the talons of some vast, slumbering beast have been torn down or reforged. Where dark sorceries once festered, the air is clear and cold, the sky no longer choked by shadow. Brave hands have scoured the endless tunnels and great halls beneath the mountain, sealing cursed vaults and breaking the last of the Witch-king's profane altars. Now, in place of ruin and fear, new fortresses rise — not of cruelty, but of stone shaped by mortal craft and blessed by those learned in light. Green banners now flutter where once the black sigil of Angmar flew, and the land itself seems to breathe easier, as if the earth groaned in relief beneath the weight lifted from it. \n\nYet even in victory, Carn Dûm remains a grim and solemn place — a monument to the price of vigilance. The bones of countless dead still rest beneath its foundations, and the wind carries faint echoes of the horrors once wrought within its walls. But that legacy no longer rules here. In time, the stronghold will serve as a watchtower on the edge of the northern wilds, a reminder that no darkness, however ancient, is beyond the power of Men to challenge and overcome. What was once a throne of shadow is now a bulwark of the kingdom, held not by fear, but by the strength and memory of those who dared to reclaim it."
 
 building_wonder_tradeport_of_hyarmenyalond_01:0 "Ruins of Taurelondë"
 building_wonder_tradeport_of_hyarmenyalond_01_desc:0 "Taurelondë, once the vibrant Elven harbor of Sirgala, stood as a gleaming beacon on the western shores, a place of trade, culture, and seafaring legend. Its white spires and graceful ships filled the waters, creating a haven for travelers seeking the wisdom of the Elves. However, when the Númenóreans colonized Arnor, the harbor was ceded to them, and the Elves quietly departed, leaving behind only their masterful architecture.\n\nOver time, as Arnor fell into ruin, so too did Taurelondë. The harbor, once bustling with life, now lies abandoned and decaying. Crumbling buildings and forgotten docks stand silent against the winds of the sea, overtaken by vines and brambles. The quiet beauty of its Elven design lingers, but the vibrant life it once held is now but a distant memory, a melancholic reminder of an age long past."

 building_wonder_tradeport_of_hyarmenyalond_02:0 "Taurelondë - The Forest Haven"
 building_wonder_tradeport_of_hyarmenyalond_02_desc:0 "After centuries of silence, Arnor has returned to reclaim the ancient harbor of Taurelondë. Once abandoned and forgotten, the city is being restored to its former glory under the banner of the Northern Kingdom. The crumbling spires and decaying docks are being carefully repaired, and the sea once again echoes with the sounds of ships arriving. Skilled artisans and laborers work tirelessly to restore the harbor’s grand architecture, blending Númenórean craftsmanship with the elegance of the Elven designs that still grace the city.\n\nThe revitalization of Taurelondë marks a new era for Arnor, as the city once again becomes a key hub of trade and culture in the north. The bustling docks are once more filled with vessels carrying goods and travelers from distant lands, while the streets come alive with merchants, scholars, and sailors. Though the shadows of its long abandonment still linger, Taurelondë is slowly being reborn, a symbol of Arnor’s strength and a bridge to the ancient legacy of the Elves."
 
 #building_wonder_edhelas_01:0 "Ruined Halls of Edhelas"
 #building_wonder_edhelas_01_desc:0 "The Halls of Edhelas stand in solemn grandeur on the misty southeastern shores, not far from the Grey Havens, hidden amidst the ancient woods of Sirgala. Built into the hillsides and woven seamlessly with the surrounding forest, the halls are a marvel of Elven architecture — elegant yet enduring, blending stone, wood, and silver into a harmonious whole. These halls were the proud home of King Bornmir, the last ruler of Sirgala, whose reign was marked by wisdom and grace before the fading of the Elves in the west. Inside, the chambers are lined with tapestries depicting the tales of Sirgala’s ancient glories, and the air carries the faint scent of the sea mixed with the fragrant blooms of the surrounding woods.\n\nThough long abandoned after Bornmir's departure, the Halls of Edhelas still retain the aura of a once-thriving court. The soft light of the stars filters through high arched windows, casting a gentle glow on the polished floors and intricate carvings that adorn every surface. Outside, the gardens remain untouched by time, with ancient trees and flowering vines twisting around stone columns. The halls now stand as a quiet monument to the last of the Elven kings, a place of peace and reflection, where the echoes of Sirgala’s past linger in the wind, and the wisdom of the Elves remains, waiting for those who would seek it."

 #building_wonder_edhelas_02:0 "Halls of Edhelas Renewed"
 #building_wonder_edhelas_02_desc:0 "The Halls of Edhelas now shine once more under the stewardship of the Elves, as the ancient home of King Bornmir is reclaimed and renewed by those who have returned to the shores of Sirgala. The once-abandoned halls, long shrouded in silence, are alive again with the hum of Elven voices and the soft sound of harp strings. The gardens, once wild and untamed, have flourished under careful tending, with ancient trees now standing proud and resplendent, their boughs heavy with blossom and fruit. The halls themselves have been meticulously restored, their gleaming stonework and intricate carvings imbued with new life, reflecting the grace and timeless beauty of the Elvenkind who call it home once more.\n\nWhere once the shadows of abandonment loomed, there is now the warmth of a living court. Silver light filters through high windows, illuminating halls filled with the soft glow of Elven lamps. In the great chambers, the banners of Sirgala wave once more, their golden threads catching the light of the stars. The air is filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the sea’s briny breeze, blending with the songs of Elven voices echoing through the halls, as if the very land has awakened with the return of its people. The Halls of Edhelas are no longer just a memory of an age long past; they are once again the beating heart of Sirgala, a beacon of Elven heritage and hope for the future, where the wisdom of the past merges with the dreams of a new beginning."
 
 building_wonder_angle_of_eriador:0 "Angle of Eriador"
 building_wonder_angle_of_eriador_desc:0 "The Angle of Eriador stands as a solitary stronghold, a land of quiet strength and enduring legacy, where the scattered Dúnedain of Arnor have found refuge after the fall of their once-great kingdom. Nestled between the windswept hills and the shores of the northern rivers, this remote region has become a haven for the last of the Dúnedain, a place where their ancient bloodline continues in secret, hidden from the encroaching darkness of the world. The ruins of old Arnor, distant but ever-present, remind them of their lost heritage, yet the Dúnedain hold fast to their duty, preserving the memory of their kingdom in the silence of the wilderness.\n\nThough the Angle is sparsely populated, it is rich in history and pride. The Dúnedain have built their homes among the ancient woods and rolling plains, constructing strongholds and watchtowers to guard against the ever-present threat of Orcs and the forces of darkness. The great banners of the North no longer fly over the walls of cities, but the hearts of these Men burn with a quiet fire — one that will not be extinguished by time. Hidden within the remote fastnesses of the Angle, the Dúnedain remain vigilant, preserving the knowledge of their ancestors, safeguarding the bloodline of kings, and keeping watch over the borders of Eriador. Though the world may have forgotten them, they stand as a living testament to the resilience of the Dúnedain, a silent watch over the fading legacy of Arnor, ready to rise once more when the need is greatest."

 #building_wonder_minas_formen_01:0 "Minas Formen"
 #building_wonder_minas_formen_01_desc:0 "Minas Formen, the Tower of the North, stands resolute against the winds of time and the harsh elements that have battered the land of Rhudaur since its construction. Built by the Men of Arnor to defend the kingdom from the encroaching forces of Angmar, the tower was once the heart of a great fortress, its stone walls rising high above the plains and forests of the north. Though the kingdom of Rhudaur fell to the shadow of Angmar long ago, Minas Formen endures as a silent monument to the steadfast resolve of those who once called it home. Its design, unique among the towers of old, was crafted with both defense and longevity in mind — its deep foundations anchored in the rock beneath, and its strong, sweeping curves designed to withstand siege and storm alike.\n\nThe centuries have passed, and the once bustling stronghold now stands as a solitary sentinel overlooking the desolation of Rhudaur. Yet its strength remains undiminished, with its distinctive architecture still holding firm against the ravages of time. The tower’s high walls, intricately crafted windows, and expansive courtyards have all withstood the ages, and the secretive, spiral staircases continue to wind their way upward, offering a commanding view of the land below. Where many fortresses have crumbled, the ingenuity of Minas Formen’s design has allowed it to endure, its ancient stones weathered but unbroken. Now, though the kingdoms of old are gone, the tower stands as a relic of a bygone age — a silent guardian of the north, enduring through millennia, a testament to the strength of its creators and the defiance of its last defenders."

The once-ruined city has been reborn with wide, majestic streets lined with white stone buildings, each one a testament to both ancient artistry and the enduring power of Men. High arches, intricate carvings, and delicate windows in the elven style are balanced by the solid, imposing walls and fortifications of númenórean design. Great halls and watchtowers now dominate the skyline, their silhouettes cutting through the mist, while expansive courtyards filled with statues and fountains mirror the elegance of the Elven city that once stood here. The city hums with life, a proud new incarnation of the ancient marvel — a beacon of Arnor’s strength, built to stand the test of time."
